Changelog

5.5.5
-Dynamic Fsync (Enable this only if you are sure your device is stable! If you have too many reboots, your data may get corrupted and you will have to reflash your ROM.)
-Simple GPU Governor
-Intelliplug hotplug driver with Eco mode (dual core operations). When this is disabled, it will use crpalmer's hot-plug driver.
-Intellidemand tweaks - I'm still working on this one, it tends to have random reboots at the moment.
-Decrease GPU OC to 533 MHz and increase bandwidth
-1917 MHz overclock is back, should be more stable now
-Sweep2wake + Sweep2Sleep
-Doubletap2sleep is not implemented in this version, sorry. Use your ROM's dt2s feature for now. I do plan on adding this back.
-Doubletap2wake can be used anywhere on the screen
-There should be scripts for all features, let me know if I missed something.
-Undervolt override for high overclocks. You can globally undervolt while leaving 1836 MHz, 1890 MHz, and 1917 MHz clocks unaffected.
-L2 cache overclock
-600 MHz bus overclock for 1674 MHz - 1917 MHz frequencies
-Support for F2FS filesystem (F2FS TWRP and MultiROM are coming as well, as soon as I have time to test)
-FIOPS I/O Scheduler

5.6.4:
-Hopefully fix voltage for "faster" binned chips
-Fixed random reboots when using intellidemand governor
-Fix scripts
-Disable intellidemand's active max frequency to prevent it from interfering with overclock
-Enable additional TCP congestion algorithms
-Sync s2w/dt2w/pocket detection with Beastmode
-Add Preservative governor (credits to bedalus)
-Update BFQ I/O Scheduler to v7r2
-Merge latest CM commits
-Merge crpalmer's latest commits
-Update to Linux 3.4.79
-Add LZ4 kernel compression/decompression for faster boot

5.7.6:
-NOTE: There are 2 different zips for this version to avoid conflicts between crpalmer's simple plug and faux123's intelliplug. 
-IMPORTANT: On the intelliplug version, intelliplug is enabled by default. If you disable intelliplug, there will be no hotplug driver running which will kill your battery quickly. So if you decide you don't want to use intellidemand, please use the simple plug version instead.
-Memory optimizations from Motorola
-Enable Linaro's power-efficient workqueues
-Intelliplug updates
-Merge latest CM commits
-Merge crpalmer's latest commits
-Update to Linux 3.4.86
-Update F2FS to the latest version
